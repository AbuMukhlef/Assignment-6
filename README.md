# It is imperative to verify that the <!--Links-->[Dart](https://dart.dev/)<!--Links--> language is installed on your machine before proceeding.

## Features
1. ###### Add Device to cart
3. ###### Delete Device from cart
4. ###### Display Display cart
5. ###### Compared  Devices's Model

## how to use it
* You **must** initially add an device to the cart, you must repeat this process every time you start. Why? Because we store in a list, not in a database, **so you must pay attention to that**.
